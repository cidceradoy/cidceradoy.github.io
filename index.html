			<h2><p>Hello! (a.) I am Cid Jezreel C. Ceradoy and you can call me (b.) Cid. As of the moment, (c.) my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 22 because OOP is such a cool programming paradigm. (d.) In terms of GE, Hist 1 is the one I like the most because I find history interesting since my elementary days. (e.) Eventhough C is not an OOP language, it is my favorite programming language (old school, right?) because it's so old that you have to do a simple task manually without much relying on helpful libraries and I think it's beautiful but a bit taxing. (f.) Also, I love lumpiang togue paired with spicy vinegar hehe.</p></h2>
